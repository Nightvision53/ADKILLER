# ADKILLER


## BLOCK EVERY AD ON EVERY WEBSITE OR PROGRAM ON YOUR COMPUTER WITH JUST ONE CLICK


## Description

When you want to connect a website, your computer requests IP adress from your DNS server. But if your computer has that IP adress in its hosts file, then it tries to connect that
IP adress. 

What we are doing is adding a blacklist to our hosts file that makes whenever computer tries to connect an ad provider site, it's tries to connect local host instead of going to DNS server.
Than of course there is no response. 

## Prequests
You need to install this [hosts](https://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.zip) file and unzip to the same directory with `main.py`.


Python version 3 required.
